<h1>Welcome to Intro to Web Development</h1>
<p>
    Here you can see the basics of web development in practice, 
    based on my learning from a web development course at <a href="https://lacc.edu">Los Angeles City College</a>. 
    The textbook used for the course is <cite>New Perspectives on HTML5 and CSS3, Comprehensive 8th Edition</cite> by Patrick Carey.
    You can find it 
    <a href="https://www.cengage.com/c/new-perspectives-on-html-5-and-css-comprehensive-comprehensive-8e-carey/9780357107140/">on Cengage</a> 
    or elsewhere on the internet.
